  abstract = {The human thymus is the organ responsible for the maturation of many types of T cells, which are immune cells that protect us from infection. However, it is not well known how these cells develop with a full immune complement that contains the necessary variation to protect us from a variety of pathogens. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing on more than 250,000 cells, Park et al. examined the changes that occur in the thymus over the course of a human life. They found that development occurs in a coordinated manner among immune cells and with their developmental microenvironment. These data allowed for the creation of models of how T cells with different specific immune functions develop in humans. Science, this issue p. eaay3224 Single-cell RNA profiles of the human thymus over time elucidate aspects of human immunological T cell development. The thymus provides a nurturing environment for the differentiation and selection of T cells, a process orchestrated by their interaction with multiple thymic cell types. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8αα+ T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the life span with new insights into human T cell development.},

  abstract = {The disruption in blood supply due to myocardial infarction is a critical determinant for infarct size and subsequent deterioration in function. The identification of factors that enhance cardiac repair by the restoration of the vascular network is, therefore, of great significance. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is increased in stressed cardiomyocytes and induces a cardioprotective cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis after ischemia. Single-cell sequencing indicates ZEB2 to be enriched in injured cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ZEB2 results in impaired cardiac contractility and infarct healing post-myocardial infarction (post-MI), while cardiomyocyte-specific ZEB2 overexpression improves cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function. We identified Thymosin $\beta$4 (TMSB4) and Prothymosin $\alpha$ (PTMA) as main paracrine factors released from cardiomyocytes to stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell migration, and whose regulation is validated in our in vivo models. Therapeutic delivery of ZEB2 to cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart induces the expression of TMSB4 and PTMA, which enhances angiogenesis and prevents cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal ZEB2 as a beneficial factor during ischemic injury, which may hold promise for the identification of new therapies.},

Tissue ischemia induced by infarction leads to profound changes in endothelial cell functions and can induce transition to a mesenchymal state. Here we explore the kinetics and individual cellular responses of endothelial cells after myocardial infarction by using single cell RNA sequencing. This study demonstrates a time dependent switch in endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation associated with transient changes in metabolic gene signatures. Trajectory analysis reveals that the majority of endothelial cells 3 to 7 days after myocardial infarction acquire a transient state, characterized by mesenchymal gene expression, which returns to baseline 14 days after injury. Lineage tracing, using the Cdh5-CreERT2;mT/mG mice followed by single cell RNA sequencing, confirms the transient mesenchymal transition and reveals additional hypoxic and inflammatory signatures of endothelial cells during early and late states after injury. These data suggest that endothelial cells undergo a transient mes-enchymal activation concomitant with a metabolic adaptation within the first days after myocardial infarction but do not acquire a long-term mesenchymal fate. This mesenchymal activation may facilitate endothelial cell migration and clonal expansion to regenerate the vascular network.},

Cardiac ischemia leads to the loss of myocardial tissue and the activation of a repair process that culminates in the formation of a scar whose structural characteristics dictate propensity to favorable healing or detrimental cardiac wall rupture. To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome.},

The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.},

The adult mammalian heart is incapable of regeneration following injury. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart can efficiently regenerate during the first week of life. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the regenerative response and its blockade in later life are not understood. Here, by single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we map the dynamic transcriptional landscape of five distinct cardiomyocyte populations in healthy, injured, and regenerating mouse hearts. We identify immature cardiomyocytes that enter the cell cycle following injury and disappear as the heart loses the ability to regenerate. These proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes display a unique transcriptional program dependent on nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYa) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 1 (NFE2L1) transcription factors, which exert proliferative and protective functions, respectively. Cardiac overexpression of these two factors conferred protection against ischemic injury in mature mouse hearts that were otherwise non-regenerative. These findings advance our understanding of the cellular basis of neonatal heart regeneration and reveal a transcriptional landscape for heart repair following injury.},

  abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that B cells and antibodies can influence inflammation and remodelling following a myocardial infarction (MI) and culminating in heart failure—but the mechanisms underlying these observations remain elusive. We therefore conducted in mice a deep phenotyping of the post-MI B-cell responses in infarcted hearts and mediastinal lymph nodes, which drain the myocardium. Thereby, we sought to dissect the mechanisms controlling B-cell mobilization and activity in situ.Histological, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses revealed a rapid accumulation of diverse B-cell subsets in infarcted murine hearts, paralleled by mild clonal expansion of germinal centre B cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. The repertoire of cardiac B cells was largely polyclonal and showed no sign of antigen-driven clonal expansion. Instead, it included a distinct subset exclusively found in the heart, herein termed ‘heart-associated B cells’ (hB) that expressed high levels of Cd69 as an activation marker, C-C-chemokine receptor type 7 (Ccr7), CXC-chemokine receptor type 5 (Cxcr5), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1). This distinct signature was not shared with any other cell population in the healing myocardium. Moreover, we detected a myocardial gradient of CXC-motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13, the ligand of CXCR5) on Days 1 and 5 post-MI. When compared with wild-type controls, mice treated with a neutralizing CXCL13-specific antibody as well as CXCR5-deficient mice showed reduced post-MI infiltration of B cells and reduced local Tgfb1 expression but no differences in contractile function nor myocardial morphology were observed between groups.Our study reveals that polyclonal B cells showing no sign of antigen-specificity readily infiltrate the heart after MI via the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis and contribute to local TGF-ß1 production. The local B-cell responses are paralleled by mild antigen-driven germinal centre reactions in the mediastinal lymph nodes that might ultimately lead to the production of specific antibodies. }},

Systematic analysis of cellular compositions and cell--cell interaction networks showed that CM contractility and metabolism are the most prominent aspects that are correlated with changes in heart function. We also uncovered active engagement of NCMs in regulating the behaviour of CMs, exemplified by ACKR1+-endothelial cells, injection of which preserved cardiac function after injury.

Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of the repair process following ischemic cardiac injury is a crucial determinant for the progression into heart failure and is controlled by both intra- and intercellular signaling within the heart. An enhanced understanding of this complex interplay will enable better exploitation of these mechanisms for therapeutic use. We used single-cell transcriptomics to collect gene expression data of all main cardiac cell types at different time-points after ischemic injury. These data unveiled cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity and changes in cellular function during cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, we established potential intercellular communication networks after ischemic injury. Follow up experiments confirmed that cardiomyocytes express and secrete elevated levels of beta-2 microglobulin in response to ischemic damage, which can activate fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. Collectively, our data indicate phase-specific changes in cellular heterogeneity during different stages of cardiac remodeling and allow for the identification of therapeutic targets relevant for cardiac repair.},

In particular, the pig has emerged as an essential cardiovascular disease model, because its heart, circulatory system, and blood supply are anatomically and functionally similar to that of humans. Currently, molecular and omics-based studies in the pig are hampered by the incompleteness of the genome and the lack of diversity of the corresponding transcriptome annotation. Here, we employed Nanopore long-read sequencing and in-depth proteomics on top of Illumina RNA-seq to enhance the pig cardiac transcriptome annotation. We assembled 15,926 transcripts, stratified into coding and non-coding, and validated our results by complementary mass spectrometry. A manual review of several gene loci, which are associated with cardiac function, corroborated the utility of our enhanced annotation. All our data are available for download and are provided as tracks for integration in genome browsers. We deem this resource as highly valuable for molecular research in an increasingly relevant large animal model.},

Here we describe the first comprehensive AS landscape in the spectrum of human prostate cancer (PCa) evolution. We find that the severity of splicing dysregulation correlates with disease progression and establish intron retention as a hallmark of PCa stemness and aggressiveness. Systematic interrogation of 274 splicing-regulatory genes (SRGs) uncovers prevalent genomic copy number variations (CNVs), leading to mis-expression of {\textasciitilde}68{\%} of SRGs during PCa development and progression. Consequently, many SRGs are prognostic. Surprisingly, androgen receptor controls a splicing program distinct from its transcriptional regulation. The spliceosome modulator, E7107, reverses cancer aggressiveness and inhibits castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) in xenograft and autochthonous PCa models. Altogether, our studies establish aberrant AS landscape caused by dysregulated SRGs as a hallmark of PCa aggressiveness and the spliceosome as a therapeutic vulnerability for CRPC.},

  abstract = {Driven by rapidly evolving technologies in next-generation sequencing, alternative splicing has emerged as a crucial layer in gene expression, greatly expanding protein diversity and governing complex biological processes in the cardiomyocyte. At the core of cardiac contraction, the physical properties of the sarcomere are carefully orchestrated through alternative splicing to fit the varying demands on the heart. By the recent discovery of RBM20 and RBM24, two major heart and skeletal muscle-restricted splicing factors, it became evident that alternative splicing events in the heart occur in regulated networks rather than in isolated events. Analysis of knockout mice of these splice factors has shed light on the importance of these fundamental processes in the heart. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role and regulation of alternative splicing in the developing and diseased heart, specifically within the sarcomere. Through various examples (titin, myomesin, troponin T, tropomyosin and LDB3) we illustrate how alternative splicing regulates the functional properties of the sarcomere. Finally, we evaluate opportunities and obstacles to modulate alternative splicing in therapeutic approaches for cardiac disease.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: A causal genetic mutation is found in 40{\%} of families with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), leaving a large percentage of families genetically unsolved. This prevents adequate counseling and clear recommendations in these families. We aim to identify novel genes or modifiers associated with DCM. METHODS: We performed computational ranking of human genes based on coexpression with a predefined set of genes known to be associated with DCM, which allowed us to prioritize gene candidates for their likelihood of being involved in DCM. Top candidates will be checked for variants in the available whole-exome sequencing data of 142 DCM patients. RNA was isolated from cardiac biopsies to investigate gene expression. RESULTS: PDLIM5 was classified as the top candidate. An interesting heterozygous variant (189{\_}190delinsGG) was found in a DCM patient with a known pathogenic truncating TTN-variant. The PDLIM5 loss-of-function (LoF) variant affected all cardiac-specific isoforms of PDLIM5 and no LoF variants were detected in the same region in a control cohort of 26,000 individuals. RNA expression of PDLIM5 and its direct interactors (MYOT, LDB3, and MYOZ2) was increased in cardiac tissue of this patient, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism. The PDLIM5 variant cosegregated with the TTN-variant and the phenotype, leading to a high disease penetrance in this family. A second patient was an infant with a homozygous 10 kb-deletion of exon 2 in PDLIM5 resulting in early-onset cardiac disease, showing the importance of PDLIM5 in cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous PDLIM5 variants are rare and therefore will not have a major contribution in DCM. Although they likely play a role in disease development as this gene plays a major role in contracting cardiomyocytes and homozygous variants lead to early-onset cardiac disease. Other environmental and/or genetic factors are probably necessary to unveil the cardiac phenotype in PDLIM5 mutation carriers.},

  abstract  = {Secreted protein, acidic, and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that functions in the extracellular processing of newly synthesized collagen. Collagen deposition to form a scar is a key event following a myocardial infarction (MI). Because the roles of SPARC in the early post-MI setting have not been defined, we examined age-matched wild-type (WT; n=22) and SPARC-deficient (null; n=25) mice at day 3 post-MI. Day 0 WT (n=28) and null (n=20) mice served as controls. Infarct size was 52 {\textpm} 2{\%} for WT and 47 {\textpm} 2{\%} for SPARC null (P=NS), indicating that the MI injury was comparable in the two groups. By echocardiography, WT mice increased end-diastolic volumes from 45 {\textpm} 2 to 83 {\textpm} 5 $\mu$l (P < 0.05). SPARC null mice also increased end-diastolic volumes but to a lesser extent than WT (39 {\textpm} 3 to 63 {\textpm} 5 $\mu$l; P < 0.05 vs. day 0 controls and vs. WT day 3 MI). Ejection fraction fell post-MI in WT mice from 57 {\textpm} 2 to 19 {\textpm} 1{\%}. The decrease in ejection fraction was attenuated in the absence of SPARC (65 {\textpm} 2 to 28 {\textpm} 2{\%}). Fibroblasts isolated from SPARC null left ventricle (LV) showed differences in the expression of 22 genes encoding extracellular matrix and adhesion molecule genes, including fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; CCN2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2). The change in fibroblast gene expression levels was mirrored in tissue protein extracts for fibronectin, CTGF, and MMP-3 but not TIMP-2. Combined, the results of this study indicate that SPARC deletion preserves LV function at day 3 post-MI but may be detrimental for the long-term response due to impaired fibroblast activation.},

  abstract = {Clusterin (CLU) is induced in many organs after tissue injury or remodeling. Recently, we show that CLU levels are increased in plasma and left ventricle (LV) after MI, however, the mechanisms involved are not yet elucidated. On the other hand, it has been shown that the activity of the protein degradation systems (PDS) is affected after MI with a decrease in ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and an increase in macroautophagy. The aim of this study was to decipher if the increased CLU levels after MI are in part due to the alteration of PDS activity. Rat neonate cardiomyocytes (NCM) were treated with different modulators of UPS and macroautophagy in order to decipher their role in CLU expression, secretion, and degradation. We observed that inhibition of UPS activity in NCM increased CLU mRNA levels, its intracellular protein levels (p-CLU and m-CLU) and its secreted form (s-CLU). Macroautophagy was also induced after MG132 treatment but is not active. The inhibition of macroautophagy induction in MG132-treated NCM increased CLU mRNA and m-CLU levels, but not s-CLU compared to NCM only treated by MG132. We also demonstrate that CLU can be degraded in NCM through proteasome and lysosome by a macroautophagy independent pathway. In another hand, CLU silencing in NCM has no effect either on macroautophagy or apoptosis induced by MG132. However, the overexpression of CLU secreted isoform in H9c2 cells, but not in NCM decreased apoptosis after MG132 treatment. Finally, we observed that increased CLU levels in hypertrophied NCM and in failing human hearts are associated with proteasome inhibition and macroautophagy alteration. All these data suggest that increased CLU expression and secretion after MI is, in part, due to a defect of UPS and macroautophagy activities in the heart and may have a protective effect by decreasing apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition.},

It relies on recently developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, providing effective control of type I errors and yielding high statistical power. With a computationally efficient algorithm, which is based on penalized quasi-likelihood, SPARK is also scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples.

  abstract  = {Accumulating evidence indicates an important role for non-coding RNA molecules in eukaryotic cell regulation. A small number of coding and non-coding overlapping antisense transcripts (OATs) in eukaryotes have been reported, some of which regulate expression of the corresponding sense transcript. The prevalence of this phenomenon is unknown, but there may be an enrichment of such transcripts at imprinted gene loci. Taking a bioinformatics approach, we systematically searched a human mRNA database (RefSeq) for complementary regions that might facilitate pairing with other transcripts. We report 56 pairs of overlapping transcripts, in which each member of the pair is transcribed from the same locus. This allows us to make an estimate of 1000 for the minimum number of such transcript pairs in the entire human genome. This is a surprisingly large number of overlapping gene pairs and, clearly, some of the overlaps may not be functionally significant. Nonetheless, this may indicate an important general role for overlapping antisense control in gene regulation. EST databases were also investigated in order to address the prevalence of cases of imprinted genes with associated non-coding overlapping, antisense transcripts. However, EST databases were found to be completely inappropriate for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Non-coding RNAs are involved in epigenetic processes, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. A particular group of ncRNA are natural antisense transcripts (NATs); these are transcribed in the opposite direction to protein coding transcripts and are widespread in eukaryotes. Their abundance, evidence of phylogenetic conservation and an increasing number of well-characterized examples of antisense-mediated gene regulation are indicative of essential biological roles of NATs. There is evidence to suggest that they interfere with their corresponding sense transcript to elicit concordant and discordant regulation. The main mechanisms involved include transcriptional interference as well as dsRNA formation. Sense–antisense hybrid formation can trigger RNA interference, RNA editing or protein kinase R. However, the exact molecular mechanisms elicited by NATs in the context of these regulatory roles are currently poorly understood. Several examples confirm that ectopic expression of antisense transcripts trigger epigenetic silencing of the related sense transcript. Genomic approaches suggest that the antisense transcriptome carries a broader biological significance which goes beyond the physiological regulation of the directly related sense transcripts. Because NATs show evidence of conservation we speculate that they played a role in evolution, with early eukaryotes gaining selective advantage through the regulatory effects. With the surge of genome and transcriptome sequencing projects, there is promise of a more comprehensive understanding of the biological role of NATs and the regulatory mechanisms involved.},

  abstract = {Endogenous antisense RNA has been detected for a range of eukaryotic genes and now appears to be a common phenomenon in mammalian cells. Its abundance compared to levels of its complementary sense mRNA indicates that antisense RNA may be involved in posttrancriptional regulation of a gene. In general a downregulating effect on gene expression has been demonstrated or suggested. Due to the heterogeneity in origin and character of different antisense transcripts alternative functions such as stabilizing the corresponding sense transcript and being part of gene recombination must be considered. Regulation by endogenous antisense RNA has been shown for a plethora of genes, including cardiac genes, such as myosin heavy chainMHC, atrial light chain, and troponin I. There is now growing evidence that antisense transcription is involved in human disease, and it is reasonable to consider antisense as a target for intervention procedures. Here we review the progress in our understanding of as well as the controversies arising from investigating the regulatory mechanisms of antisense RNA, with special focus on cardiac genes. Finally, links between antisense transcription and heart disease and the possible use of antisense as a target of cardiac intervention procedures are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a central regulator of blood volume and a therapeutic target in hypertension and heart failure. Enhanced ANP activity in such conditions through inhibition of the degradative enzyme neprilysin has shown clinical efficacy but is complicated by consequences of simultaneous accumulation of a heterogeneous array of other hormones. Targets for specific ANP enhancement have not been available. Here, we describe a cis-acting antisense transcript (NPPA-AS1), which negatively regulates ANP expression in human cardiomyocytes. We show that NPPA-AS1 regulates ANP expression via facilitating NPPA repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) binding to its promoter, rather than forming an RNA duplex with ANP mRNA. Expression of ANP mRNA and NPPA-AS1 was increased and correlated in isolated strained human cardiomyocytes and in hearts from patients with advanced heart failure. Further, inhibition of NPPA-AS1 in vitro and in vivo resulted in increased myocardial expression of ANP, increased circulating ANP, increased renal cGMP, and lower blood pressure. The effects of NPPA-AS1 inhibition on NPPA expression in human cardiomyocytes were further marked under cell-strain conditions. Collectively, these results implicate the antisense transcript NPPA-AS1 as part of a physiologic self-regulatory ANP circuit and a viable target for specific ANP augmentation.},
