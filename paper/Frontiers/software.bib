  abstract = {eart diseases (HDs) represent a common group of diseases that involve the heart, a number of which are characterized by high morbidity and lethality. Recently, increasing evidence demonstrates diverse non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critical roles in HDs. However, currently there lacks a systematic investigation of the association between HDs and ncRNAs. Here, we developed a Heart Disease-related Non-coding RNAs Database (HDncRNA), to curate the HDs-ncRNA associations from 3 different sources including 1904 published articles, 3 existing databases [the Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD), miR2disease and lncRNAdisease] and 5 RNA-seq datasets. The HDs-ncRNA associations with experimental validations curated from these articles, HMDD, miR2disease and part of data from lncRNAdisease were ‘direct evidence’. Relationships got from high-through data in lncRNAdisease and annotated differential expressed lncRNAs from RNA-seq data were defined as ‘high-throughput associations’. Novel lncRNAs identified from RNA-seq data in HDs had least credibility and were defined as ‘predicted associations’. Currently, the database contains 2304 HDs-ncRNA associations for 133 HDs in 6 species including human, mouse, rat, pig, calf and dog. The database also has the following features: (i) A user-friendly web interface for browsing and searching the data; (ii) a visualization tool to plot miRNA and lncRNA locations in the human and mouse genomes; (iii) information about neighboring genes of lncRNAs and (iv) links to some mainstream databases including miRbase, Ensemble and Fantom Cat for the annotated lncRNAs and miRNAs. In summary, HDncRNA provides an excellent platform for exploring HDs related ncRNAs.Database URL: http://hdncrna.cardiacdev.com},

  abstract = {The APPRIS database (http://appris-tools.org) uses protein structural and functional features and information from cross-species conservation to annotate splice isoforms in protein-coding genes. APPRIS selects a single protein isoform, the 'principal' isoform, as the reference for each gene based on these annotations. A single main splice isoform reflects the biological reality for most protein coding genes and APPRIS principal isoforms are the best predictors of these main proteins isoforms. Here, we present the updates to the database, new developments that include the addition of three new species (chimpanzee, Drosophila melangaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), the expansion of APPRIS to cover the RefSeq gene set and the UniProtKB proteome for six species and refinements in the core methods that make up the annotation pipeline. In addition APPRIS now provides a measure of reliability for individual principal isoforms and updates with each release of the GENCODE/Ensembl and RefSeq reference sets. The individual GENCODE/Ensembl, RefSeq and UniProtKB reference gene sets for six organisms have been merged to produce common sets of splice variants.},

This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene- and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq.},

  abstract = {This protocol explains how to perform a fast SCENIC analysis alongside standard best practices steps on single-cell RNA-sequencing data using software containers and Nextflow pipelines. SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon's target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in <2 h.},
