  abstract = {The human thymus is the organ responsible for the maturation of many types of T cells, which are immune cells that protect us from infection. However, it is not well known how these cells develop with a full immune complement that contains the necessary variation to protect us from a variety of pathogens. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing on more than 250,000 cells, Park et al. examined the changes that occur in the thymus over the course of a human life. They found that development occurs in a coordinated manner among immune cells and with their developmental microenvironment. These data allowed for the creation of models of how T cells with different specific immune functions develop in humans. Science, this issue p. eaay3224 Single-cell RNA profiles of the human thymus over time elucidate aspects of human immunological T cell development. The thymus provides a nurturing environment for the differentiation and selection of T cells, a process orchestrated by their interaction with multiple thymic cell types. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to create a cell census of the human thymus across the life span and to reconstruct T cell differentiation trajectories and T cell receptor (TCR) recombination kinetics. Using this approach, we identified and located in situ CD8αα+ T cell populations, thymic fibroblast subtypes, and activated dendritic cell states. In addition, we reveal a bias in TCR recombination and selection, which is attributed to genomic position and the kinetics of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data provide a comprehensive atlas of the human thymus across the life span with new insights into human T cell development.},

  abstract = {The disruption in blood supply due to myocardial infarction is a critical determinant for infarct size and subsequent deterioration in function. The identification of factors that enhance cardiac repair by the restoration of the vascular network is, therefore, of great significance. Here, we show that the transcription factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) is increased in stressed cardiomyocytes and induces a cardioprotective cross-talk between cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to enhance angiogenesis after ischemia. Single-cell sequencing indicates ZEB2 to be enriched in injured cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of ZEB2 results in impaired cardiac contractility and infarct healing post-myocardial infarction (post-MI), while cardiomyocyte-specific ZEB2 overexpression improves cardiomyocyte survival and cardiac function. We identified Thymosin $\beta$4 (TMSB4) and Prothymosin $\alpha$ (PTMA) as main paracrine factors released from cardiomyocytes to stimulate angiogenesis by enhancing endothelial cell migration, and whose regulation is validated in our in vivo models. Therapeutic delivery of ZEB2 to cardiomyocytes in the infarcted heart induces the expression of TMSB4 and PTMA, which enhances angiogenesis and prevents cardiac dysfunction. These findings reveal ZEB2 as a beneficial factor during ischemic injury, which may hold promise for the identification of new therapies.},

Tissue ischemia induced by infarction leads to profound changes in endothelial cell functions and can induce transition to a mesenchymal state. Here we explore the kinetics and individual cellular responses of endothelial cells after myocardial infarction by using single cell RNA sequencing. This study demonstrates a time dependent switch in endothelial cell proliferation and inflammation associated with transient changes in metabolic gene signatures. Trajectory analysis reveals that the majority of endothelial cells 3 to 7 days after myocardial infarction acquire a transient state, characterized by mesenchymal gene expression, which returns to baseline 14 days after injury. Lineage tracing, using the Cdh5-CreERT2;mT/mG mice followed by single cell RNA sequencing, confirms the transient mesenchymal transition and reveals additional hypoxic and inflammatory signatures of endothelial cells during early and late states after injury. These data suggest that endothelial cells undergo a transient mes-enchymal activation concomitant with a metabolic adaptation within the first days after myocardial infarction but do not acquire a long-term mesenchymal fate. This mesenchymal activation may facilitate endothelial cell migration and clonal expansion to regenerate the vascular network.},

Cardiac ischemia leads to the loss of myocardial tissue and the activation of a repair process that culminates in the formation of a scar whose structural characteristics dictate propensity to favorable healing or detrimental cardiac wall rupture. To elucidate the cellular processes underlying scar formation, here we perform unbiased single-cell mRNA sequencing of interstitial cells isolated from infarcted mouse hearts carrying a genetic tracer that labels epicardial-derived cells. Sixteen interstitial cell clusters are revealed, five of which were of epicardial origin. Focusing on stromal cells, we define 11 sub-clusters, including diverse cell states of epicardial- and endocardial-derived fibroblasts. Comparing transcript profiles from post-infarction hearts in C57BL/6J and 129S1/SvImJ inbred mice, which displays a marked divergence in the frequency of cardiac rupture, uncovers an early increase in activated myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen deposition, and persistent acute phase response in 129S1/SvImJ mouse hearts, defining a crucial time window of pathological remodeling that predicts disease outcome.},

The adult mammalian heart has limited capacity for regeneration following injury, whereas the neonatal heart can readily regenerate within a short period after birth. Neonatal heart regeneration is orchestrated by multiple cell types intrinsic to the heart, as well as immune cells that infiltrate the heart after injury. To elucidate the transcriptional responses of the different cellular components of the mouse heart following injury, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing on neonatal hearts at various time points following myocardial infarction and couple the results with bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data collected at the same time points. Concomitant single-cell ATAC sequencing exposes underlying dynamics of open chromatin landscapes and regenerative gene regulatory networks of diverse cardiac cell types and reveals extracellular mediators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, angiogenesis, and fibroblast activation. Together, our data provide a transcriptional basis for neonatal heart regeneration at single-cell resolution and suggest strategies for enhancing cardiac function after injury.},

The adult mammalian heart is incapable of regeneration following injury. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart can efficiently regenerate during the first week of life. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the regenerative response and its blockade in later life are not understood. Here, by single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we map the dynamic transcriptional landscape of five distinct cardiomyocyte populations in healthy, injured, and regenerating mouse hearts. We identify immature cardiomyocytes that enter the cell cycle following injury and disappear as the heart loses the ability to regenerate. These proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes display a unique transcriptional program dependent on nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYa) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 1 (NFE2L1) transcription factors, which exert proliferative and protective functions, respectively. Cardiac overexpression of these two factors conferred protection against ischemic injury in mature mouse hearts that were otherwise non-regenerative. These findings advance our understanding of the cellular basis of neonatal heart regeneration and reveal a transcriptional landscape for heart repair following injury.},

  abstract = {{Recent studies have revealed that B cells and antibodies can influence inflammation and remodelling following a myocardial infarction (MI) and culminating in heart failure—but the mechanisms underlying these observations remain elusive. We therefore conducted in mice a deep phenotyping of the post-MI B-cell responses in infarcted hearts and mediastinal lymph nodes, which drain the myocardium. Thereby, we sought to dissect the mechanisms controlling B-cell mobilization and activity in situ.Histological, flow cytometry, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses revealed a rapid accumulation of diverse B-cell subsets in infarcted murine hearts, paralleled by mild clonal expansion of germinal centre B cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. The repertoire of cardiac B cells was largely polyclonal and showed no sign of antigen-driven clonal expansion. Instead, it included a distinct subset exclusively found in the heart, herein termed ‘heart-associated B cells’ (hB) that expressed high levels of Cd69 as an activation marker, C-C-chemokine receptor type 7 (Ccr7), CXC-chemokine receptor type 5 (Cxcr5), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (Tgfb1). This distinct signature was not shared with any other cell population in the healing myocardium. Moreover, we detected a myocardial gradient of CXC-motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13, the ligand of CXCR5) on Days 1 and 5 post-MI. When compared with wild-type controls, mice treated with a neutralizing CXCL13-specific antibody as well as CXCR5-deficient mice showed reduced post-MI infiltration of B cells and reduced local Tgfb1 expression but no differences in contractile function nor myocardial morphology were observed between groups.Our study reveals that polyclonal B cells showing no sign of antigen-specificity readily infiltrate the heart after MI via the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis and contribute to local TGF-ß1 production. The local B-cell responses are paralleled by mild antigen-driven germinal centre reactions in the mediastinal lymph nodes that might ultimately lead to the production of specific antibodies. }},

Systematic analysis of cellular compositions and cell--cell interaction networks showed that CM contractility and metabolism are the most prominent aspects that are correlated with changes in heart function. We also uncovered active engagement of NCMs in regulating the behaviour of CMs, exemplified by ACKR1+-endothelial cells, injection of which preserved cardiac function after injury.

Knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles is a fundamental first step in this endeavour. Here, using state-of-the-art analyses of large-scale single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes, we characterize six anatomical adult heart regions. Our results highlight the cellular heterogeneity of cardiomyocytes, pericytes and fibroblasts, and reveal distinct atrial and ventricular subsets of cells with diverse developmental origins and specialized properties. We define the complexity of the cardiac vasculature and its changes along the arterio-venous axis. In the immune compartment, we identify cardiac-resident macrophages with inflammatory and protective transcriptional signatures. Furthermore, analyses of cell-to-cell interactions highlight different networks of macrophages, fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes between atria and ventricles that are distinct from those of skeletal muscle. Our human cardiac cell atlas improves our understanding of the human heart and provides a valuable reference for future studies.},

  abstract = {The efficiency of the repair process following ischemic cardiac injury is a crucial determinant for the progression into heart failure and is controlled by both intra- and intercellular signaling within the heart. An enhanced understanding of this complex interplay will enable better exploitation of these mechanisms for therapeutic use. We used single-cell transcriptomics to collect gene expression data of all main cardiac cell types at different time-points after ischemic injury. These data unveiled cellular and transcriptional heterogeneity and changes in cellular function during cardiac remodeling. Furthermore, we established potential intercellular communication networks after ischemic injury. Follow up experiments confirmed that cardiomyocytes express and secrete elevated levels of beta-2 microglobulin in response to ischemic damage, which can activate fibroblasts in a paracrine manner. Collectively, our data indicate phase-specific changes in cellular heterogeneity during different stages of cardiac remodeling and allow for the identification of therapeutic targets relevant for cardiac repair.},

In particular, the pig has emerged as an essential cardiovascular disease model, because its heart, circulatory system, and blood supply are anatomically and functionally similar to that of humans. Currently, molecular and omics-based studies in the pig are hampered by the incompleteness of the genome and the lack of diversity of the corresponding transcriptome annotation. Here, we employed Nanopore long-read sequencing and in-depth proteomics on top of Illumina RNA-seq to enhance the pig cardiac transcriptome annotation. We assembled 15,926 transcripts, stratified into coding and non-coding, and validated our results by complementary mass spectrometry. A manual review of several gene loci, which are associated with cardiac function, corroborated the utility of our enhanced annotation. All our data are available for download and are provided as tracks for integration in genome browsers. We deem this resource as highly valuable for molecular research in an increasingly relevant large animal model.},

Here we describe the first comprehensive AS landscape in the spectrum of human prostate cancer (PCa) evolution. We find that the severity of splicing dysregulation correlates with disease progression and establish intron retention as a hallmark of PCa stemness and aggressiveness. Systematic interrogation of 274 splicing-regulatory genes (SRGs) uncovers prevalent genomic copy number variations (CNVs), leading to mis-expression of {\textasciitilde}68{\%} of SRGs during PCa development and progression. Consequently, many SRGs are prognostic. Surprisingly, androgen receptor controls a splicing program distinct from its transcriptional regulation. The spliceosome modulator, E7107, reverses cancer aggressiveness and inhibits castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) in xenograft and autochthonous PCa models. Altogether, our studies establish aberrant AS landscape caused by dysregulated SRGs as a hallmark of PCa aggressiveness and the spliceosome as a therapeutic vulnerability for CRPC.},

  abstract = {Driven by rapidly evolving technologies in next-generation sequencing, alternative splicing has emerged as a crucial layer in gene expression, greatly expanding protein diversity and governing complex biological processes in the cardiomyocyte. At the core of cardiac contraction, the physical properties of the sarcomere are carefully orchestrated through alternative splicing to fit the varying demands on the heart. By the recent discovery of RBM20 and RBM24, two major heart and skeletal muscle-restricted splicing factors, it became evident that alternative splicing events in the heart occur in regulated networks rather than in isolated events. Analysis of knockout mice of these splice factors has shed light on the importance of these fundamental processes in the heart. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the role and regulation of alternative splicing in the developing and diseased heart, specifically within the sarcomere. Through various examples (titin, myomesin, troponin T, tropomyosin and LDB3) we illustrate how alternative splicing regulates the functional properties of the sarcomere. Finally, we evaluate opportunities and obstacles to modulate alternative splicing in therapeutic approaches for cardiac disease.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: A causal genetic mutation is found in 40{\%} of families with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), leaving a large percentage of families genetically unsolved. This prevents adequate counseling and clear recommendations in these families. We aim to identify novel genes or modifiers associated with DCM. METHODS: We performed computational ranking of human genes based on coexpression with a predefined set of genes known to be associated with DCM, which allowed us to prioritize gene candidates for their likelihood of being involved in DCM. Top candidates will be checked for variants in the available whole-exome sequencing data of 142 DCM patients. RNA was isolated from cardiac biopsies to investigate gene expression. RESULTS: PDLIM5 was classified as the top candidate. An interesting heterozygous variant (189{\_}190delinsGG) was found in a DCM patient with a known pathogenic truncating TTN-variant. The PDLIM5 loss-of-function (LoF) variant affected all cardiac-specific isoforms of PDLIM5 and no LoF variants were detected in the same region in a control cohort of 26,000 individuals. RNA expression of PDLIM5 and its direct interactors (MYOT, LDB3, and MYOZ2) was increased in cardiac tissue of this patient, indicating a possible compensatory mechanism. The PDLIM5 variant cosegregated with the TTN-variant and the phenotype, leading to a high disease penetrance in this family. A second patient was an infant with a homozygous 10 kb-deletion of exon 2 in PDLIM5 resulting in early-onset cardiac disease, showing the importance of PDLIM5 in cardiac function. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous PDLIM5 variants are rare and therefore will not have a major contribution in DCM. Although they likely play a role in disease development as this gene plays a major role in contracting cardiomyocytes and homozygous variants lead to early-onset cardiac disease. Other environmental and/or genetic factors are probably necessary to unveil the cardiac phenotype in PDLIM5 mutation carriers.},

  abstract  = {Secreted protein, acidic, and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein that functions in the extracellular processing of newly synthesized collagen. Collagen deposition to form a scar is a key event following a myocardial infarction (MI). Because the roles of SPARC in the early post-MI setting have not been defined, we examined age-matched wild-type (WT; n=22) and SPARC-deficient (null; n=25) mice at day 3 post-MI. Day 0 WT (n=28) and null (n=20) mice served as controls. Infarct size was 52 {\textpm} 2{\%} for WT and 47 {\textpm} 2{\%} for SPARC null (P=NS), indicating that the MI injury was comparable in the two groups. By echocardiography, WT mice increased end-diastolic volumes from 45 {\textpm} 2 to 83 {\textpm} 5 $\mu$l (P < 0.05). SPARC null mice also increased end-diastolic volumes but to a lesser extent than WT (39 {\textpm} 3 to 63 {\textpm} 5 $\mu$l; P < 0.05 vs. day 0 controls and vs. WT day 3 MI). Ejection fraction fell post-MI in WT mice from 57 {\textpm} 2 to 19 {\textpm} 1{\%}. The decrease in ejection fraction was attenuated in the absence of SPARC (65 {\textpm} 2 to 28 {\textpm} 2{\%}). Fibroblasts isolated from SPARC null left ventricle (LV) showed differences in the expression of 22 genes encoding extracellular matrix and adhesion molecule genes, including fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; CCN2), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2). The change in fibroblast gene expression levels was mirrored in tissue protein extracts for fibronectin, CTGF, and MMP-3 but not TIMP-2. Combined, the results of this study indicate that SPARC deletion preserves LV function at day 3 post-MI but may be detrimental for the long-term response due to impaired fibroblast activation.},

  abstract = {Clusterin (CLU) is induced in many organs after tissue injury or remodeling. Recently, we show that CLU levels are increased in plasma and left ventricle (LV) after MI, however, the mechanisms involved are not yet elucidated. On the other hand, it has been shown that the activity of the protein degradation systems (PDS) is affected after MI with a decrease in ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and an increase in macroautophagy. The aim of this study was to decipher if the increased CLU levels after MI are in part due to the alteration of PDS activity. Rat neonate cardiomyocytes (NCM) were treated with different modulators of UPS and macroautophagy in order to decipher their role in CLU expression, secretion, and degradation. We observed that inhibition of UPS activity in NCM increased CLU mRNA levels, its intracellular protein levels (p-CLU and m-CLU) and its secreted form (s-CLU). Macroautophagy was also induced after MG132 treatment but is not active. The inhibition of macroautophagy induction in MG132-treated NCM increased CLU mRNA and m-CLU levels, but not s-CLU compared to NCM only treated by MG132. We also demonstrate that CLU can be degraded in NCM through proteasome and lysosome by a macroautophagy independent pathway. In another hand, CLU silencing in NCM has no effect either on macroautophagy or apoptosis induced by MG132. However, the overexpression of CLU secreted isoform in H9c2 cells, but not in NCM decreased apoptosis after MG132 treatment. Finally, we observed that increased CLU levels in hypertrophied NCM and in failing human hearts are associated with proteasome inhibition and macroautophagy alteration. All these data suggest that increased CLU expression and secretion after MI is, in part, due to a defect of UPS and macroautophagy activities in the heart and may have a protective effect by decreasing apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition.},

It relies on recently developed statistical formulas for hypothesis testing, providing effective control of type I errors and yielding high statistical power. With a computationally efficient algorithm, which is based on penalized quasi-likelihood, SPARK is also scalable to datasets with tens of thousands of genes measured on tens of thousands of samples.

  abstract  = {Accumulating evidence indicates an important role for non-coding RNA molecules in eukaryotic cell regulation. A small number of coding and non-coding overlapping antisense transcripts (OATs) in eukaryotes have been reported, some of which regulate expression of the corresponding sense transcript. The prevalence of this phenomenon is unknown, but there may be an enrichment of such transcripts at imprinted gene loci. Taking a bioinformatics approach, we systematically searched a human mRNA database (RefSeq) for complementary regions that might facilitate pairing with other transcripts. We report 56 pairs of overlapping transcripts, in which each member of the pair is transcribed from the same locus. This allows us to make an estimate of 1000 for the minimum number of such transcript pairs in the entire human genome. This is a surprisingly large number of overlapping gene pairs and, clearly, some of the overlaps may not be functionally significant. Nonetheless, this may indicate an important general role for overlapping antisense control in gene regulation. EST databases were also investigated in order to address the prevalence of cases of imprinted genes with associated non-coding overlapping, antisense transcripts. However, EST databases were found to be completely inappropriate for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Non-coding RNAs are involved in epigenetic processes, playing a role in the regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. A particular group of ncRNA are natural antisense transcripts (NATs); these are transcribed in the opposite direction to protein coding transcripts and are widespread in eukaryotes. Their abundance, evidence of phylogenetic conservation and an increasing number of well-characterized examples of antisense-mediated gene regulation are indicative of essential biological roles of NATs. There is evidence to suggest that they interfere with their corresponding sense transcript to elicit concordant and discordant regulation. The main mechanisms involved include transcriptional interference as well as dsRNA formation. Sense–antisense hybrid formation can trigger RNA interference, RNA editing or protein kinase R. However, the exact molecular mechanisms elicited by NATs in the context of these regulatory roles are currently poorly understood. Several examples confirm that ectopic expression of antisense transcripts trigger epigenetic silencing of the related sense transcript. Genomic approaches suggest that the antisense transcriptome carries a broader biological significance which goes beyond the physiological regulation of the directly related sense transcripts. Because NATs show evidence of conservation we speculate that they played a role in evolution, with early eukaryotes gaining selective advantage through the regulatory effects. With the surge of genome and transcriptome sequencing projects, there is promise of a more comprehensive understanding of the biological role of NATs and the regulatory mechanisms involved.},

  abstract = {Endogenous antisense RNA has been detected for a range of eukaryotic genes and now appears to be a common phenomenon in mammalian cells. Its abundance compared to levels of its complementary sense mRNA indicates that antisense RNA may be involved in posttrancriptional regulation of a gene. In general a downregulating effect on gene expression has been demonstrated or suggested. Due to the heterogeneity in origin and character of different antisense transcripts alternative functions such as stabilizing the corresponding sense transcript and being part of gene recombination must be considered. Regulation by endogenous antisense RNA has been shown for a plethora of genes, including cardiac genes, such as myosin heavy chainMHC, atrial light chain, and troponin I. There is now growing evidence that antisense transcription is involved in human disease, and it is reasonable to consider antisense as a target for intervention procedures. Here we review the progress in our understanding of as well as the controversies arising from investigating the regulatory mechanisms of antisense RNA, with special focus on cardiac genes. Finally, links between antisense transcription and heart disease and the possible use of antisense as a target of cardiac intervention procedures are discussed.},

  abstract  = {The cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a central regulator of blood volume and a therapeutic target in hypertension and heart failure. Enhanced ANP activity in such conditions through inhibition of the degradative enzyme neprilysin has shown clinical efficacy but is complicated by consequences of simultaneous accumulation of a heterogeneous array of other hormones. Targets for specific ANP enhancement have not been available. Here, we describe a cis-acting antisense transcript (NPPA-AS1), which negatively regulates ANP expression in human cardiomyocytes. We show that NPPA-AS1 regulates ANP expression via facilitating NPPA repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) binding to its promoter, rather than forming an RNA duplex with ANP mRNA. Expression of ANP mRNA and NPPA-AS1 was increased and correlated in isolated strained human cardiomyocytes and in hearts from patients with advanced heart failure. Further, inhibition of NPPA-AS1 in vitro and in vivo resulted in increased myocardial expression of ANP, increased circulating ANP, increased renal cGMP, and lower blood pressure. The effects of NPPA-AS1 inhibition on NPPA expression in human cardiomyocytes were further marked under cell-strain conditions. Collectively, these results implicate the antisense transcript NPPA-AS1 as part of a physiologic self-regulatory ANP circuit and a viable target for specific ANP augmentation.},

Motivated by an interest to put gene expression into context and delineate the spatial arrangement of cell types within a tissue, we here present a model-based probabilistic method that uses single cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data.

Although complex inflammatory-like alterations are observed around the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), little is known about the molecular changes and cellular interactions that characterize this response. We investigate here, in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in a 100-μm diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics. We demonstrate early alterations in a gene co-expression network enriched for myelin and oligodendrocyte genes (OLIGs), whereas a multicellular gene co-expression network of plaque-induced genes (PIGs) involving the complement system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation is prominent in the later phase of the disease. We confirm the majority of the observed alterations at the cellular level using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections. Genome-wide spatial transcriptomics analysis provides an unprecedented approach to untangle the dysregulated cellular network in the vicinity of pathogenic hallmarks of AD and other brain diseases.},

Here, we present a molecular approach that reveals the comprehensive transcriptional landscape of cell types populating the embryonic heart at three developmental stages and that maps cell-type-specific gene expression to specific anatomical domains. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct anatomical regions in each developmental stage. Human embryonic cardiac cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed and enriched the spatial annotation of embryonic cardiac gene expression. In situ sequencing was then used to refine these results and create a spatial subcellular map for the three developmental phases. Finally, we generated a publicly available web resource of the human developing heart to facilitate future studies on human cardiogenesis.},

Analysis of the dataset revealed over 1100 genes differentially expressed in sub-compartments. Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial region induce heart contractions, but little is known about the mechanisms underlying their development. Using our transcriptome map, we identified spatially restricted Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in pacemaker cells, which was controlled by Islet-1 activity. Moreover, Wnt/β-catenin signaling controls heart rate by regulating pacemaker cellular response to parasympathetic stimuli. Thus, this high-resolution transcriptome map incorporating all cell types in the embryonic heart can expose spatially restricted molecular pathways critical for specific cardiac functions.},

In contrast to mammals, zebrafish regenerate heart injuries via proliferation of cardiomyocytes located near the wound border. To identify regulators of cardiomyocyte proliferation, we used spatially resolved RNA sequencing (tomo-seq) and generated a high-resolution genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the regenerating zebrafish heart. Interestingly, we identified two wound border zones with distinct expression profiles, including the re-expression of embryonic cardiac genes and targets of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. Endogenous BMP signaling has been reported to be detrimental to mammalian cardiac repair. In contrast, we find that genetic or chemical inhibition of BMP signaling in zebrafish reduces cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation, ultimately compromising myocardial regeneration, while bmp2b overexpression is sufficient to enhance it. Our results provide a resource for further studies on the molecular regulation of cardiac regeneration and reveal intriguing differential cellular responses of cardiomyocytes to a conserved signaling pathway in regenerative versus non-regenerative hearts.},

We present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue slide via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were used to deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of two sets of barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 2D mosaic of tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-μm pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted by researchers with no experience in microfluidics and may find applications in a range of fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology.},

Isoform tests for DIE show better performance than exon tests. We detect hundreds of DIE events traceable to cell types, often corresponding to functionally distinct protein isoforms. Mostly, one cell type is responsible for brain-region specific DIE. However, for fewer genes, multiple cell types influence DIE. Thus, regional identity can, although rarely, override cell-type specificity. Cell types indigenous to one anatomic structure display distinctive DIE, e.g. the choroid plexus epithelium manifests distinct transcription-start-site usage. Spatial transcriptomics and long-read sequencing yield a spatially resolved splicing map.

  abstract = {eart diseases (HDs) represent a common group of diseases that involve the heart, a number of which are characterized by high morbidity and lethality. Recently, increasing evidence demonstrates diverse non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play critical roles in HDs. However, currently there lacks a systematic investigation of the association between HDs and ncRNAs. Here, we developed a Heart Disease-related Non-coding RNAs Database (HDncRNA), to curate the HDs-ncRNA associations from 3 different sources including 1904 published articles, 3 existing databases [the Human microRNA Disease Database (HMDD), miR2disease and lncRNAdisease] and 5 RNA-seq datasets. The HDs-ncRNA associations with experimental validations curated from these articles, HMDD, miR2disease and part of data from lncRNAdisease were ‘direct evidence’. Relationships got from high-through data in lncRNAdisease and annotated differential expressed lncRNAs from RNA-seq data were defined as ‘high-throughput associations’. Novel lncRNAs identified from RNA-seq data in HDs had least credibility and were defined as ‘predicted associations’. Currently, the database contains 2304 HDs-ncRNA associations for 133 HDs in 6 species including human, mouse, rat, pig, calf and dog. The database also has the following features: (i) A user-friendly web interface for browsing and searching the data; (ii) a visualization tool to plot miRNA and lncRNA locations in the human and mouse genomes; (iii) information about neighboring genes of lncRNAs and (iv) links to some mainstream databases including miRbase, Ensemble and Fantom Cat for the annotated lncRNAs and miRNAs. In summary, HDncRNA provides an excellent platform for exploring HDs related ncRNAs.Database URL: http://hdncrna.cardiacdev.com},

APPRIS selects a single protein isoform, the 'principal' isoform, as the reference for each gene based on these annotations. A single main splice isoform reflects the biological reality for most protein coding genes and APPRIS principal isoforms are the best predictors of these main proteins isoforms. Here, we present the updates to the database, new developments that include the addition of three new species (chimpanzee, Drosophila melangaster and Caenorhabditis elegans), the expansion of APPRIS to cover the RefSeq gene set and the UniProtKB proteome for six species and refinements in the core methods that make up the annotation pipeline. In addition APPRIS now provides a measure of reliability for individual principal isoforms and updates with each release of the GENCODE/Ensembl and RefSeq reference sets. The individual GENCODE/Ensembl, RefSeq and UniProtKB reference gene sets for six organisms have been merged to produce common sets of splice variants.},

This has triggered the development of bespoke scRNA-seq DE methods to cope with zero inflation. Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated scRNA-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk RNA-seq tools. We introduce a weighting strategy, based on a zero-inflated negative binomial model, that identifies excess zero counts and generates gene- and cell-specific weights to unlock bulk RNA-seq DE pipelines for zero-inflated data, boosting performance for scRNA-seq.},

  abstract = {This protocol explains how to perform a fast SCENIC analysis alongside standard best practices steps on single-cell RNA-sequencing data using software containers and Nextflow pipelines. SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon's target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in <2 h.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-sequencing has become a widely used, powerful approach for studying cell populations. However, these methods often generate multiplet artifacts, where two or more cells receive the same barcode, resulting in a hybrid transcriptome. In most experiments, multiplets account for several percent of transcriptomes and can confound downstream data analysis. Here, we present Single-Cell Remover of Doublets (Scrublet), a framework for predicting the impact of multiplets in a given analysis and identifying problematic multiplets. Scrublet avoids the need for expert knowledge or cell clustering by simulating multiplets from the data and building a nearest neighbor classifier. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we test Scrublet on several datasets that include independent knowledge of cell multiplets. Scrublet is freely available for download at github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet.},

  abstract = {The ability to quantify differentiation potential of single cells is a task of critical importance. Here we demonstrate, using over 7,000 single-cell RNA-Seq profiles, that differentiation potency of a single cell can be approximated by computing the signalling promiscuity, or entropy, of a cell's transcriptome in the context of an interaction network, without the need for feature selection. We show that signalling entropy provides a more accurate and robust potency estimate than other entropy-based measures, driven in part by a subtle positive correlation between the transcriptome and connectome. Signalling entropy identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency and drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those derived from circulating tumour cells. It further reveals that expression heterogeneity within single-cell populations is regulated. In summary, signalling entropy allows in silico estimation of the differentiation potency and plasticity of single cells and bulk samples, providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem-cell phenotypes.},

  abstract  = {The current ecosystem of single cell RNA-seq platforms is rapidly expanding, but robust solutions for single cell and single molecule full- length RNA sequencing are virtually absent. A high-throughput solution that covers all aspects is necessary to study the complex life of mRNA on the single cell level. The Nanopore platform offers long read sequencing and can be integrated with the popular single cell sequencing method on the 10x Chromium platform. However, the high error-rate of Nanopore reads poses a challenge in downstream processing (e.g. for cell barcode assignment). We propose a solution to this particular problem by using a hybrid sequencing approach on Nanopore and Illumina platforms. Our software ScNapBar enables cell barcode assignment with high accuracy, especially if sequencing satura- tion is low. ScNapBar uses unique molecular identifier (UMI) or Na{\i}ve Bayes probabilistic approaches in the barcode assignment, depending on the available Illumina sequencing depth. We have benchmarked the two approaches on simulated and real Nanopore datasets. We further applied ScNapBar to pools of cells with an active or a silenced non-sense mediated RNA decay pathway. Our Nanopore read assignment distinguishes the respective cell populations and reveals characteristic nonsense-mediated mRNA decay events depending on cell status.},

However, it is not straightforward to compare gene expression levels across datasets and to automatically assign cell type labels in a new dataset based on existing annotations. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi-tools.},

However, their use remains limited by their immaturity and heterogeneity. To characterize the source of this heterogeneity, we applied complementary single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq technologies over time during hiPSC cardiac differentiation and in the adult heart. Using integrated transcriptomic and splicing analysis, more than half a dozen distinct single-cell populations were observed, several of which were coincident at a single time-point, day 30 of differentiation. To dissect the role of distinct cardiac transcriptional regulators associated with each cell population, we systematically tested the effect of a gain or loss of three transcription factors (NR2F2, TBX5, and HEY2), using CRISPR genome editing and ChIP-seq, in conjunction with patch clamp, calcium imaging, and CyTOF analysis. These targets, data, and integrative genomics analysis methods provide a powerful platform for understanding in vitro cellular heterogeneity.},

However, those approaches only allow analysis of one extremity of the transcript after short read sequencing. In consequence, information on splicing and sequence heterogeneity is lost. To overcome this limitation, several approaches that use long-read sequencing were introduced recently. Yet, those techniques are limited by low sequencing depth and/or lacking or inaccurate assignment of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), which are critical for elimination of PCR bias and artifacts. We introduce ScNaUmi-seq, an approach that combines the high throughput of Oxford Nanopore sequencing with an accurate cell barcode and UMI assignment strategy. UMI guided error correction allows to generate high accuracy full length sequence information with the 10x Genomics single cell isolation system at high sequencing depths. We analyzed transcript isoform diversity in embryonic mouse brain and show that ScNaUmi-seq allows defining splicing and SNVs (RNA editing) at a single cell level.},

  abstract = { Subtle changes in RNA transcript isoform expression can have dramatic effects on cellular behavior in both health and disease. As such, comprehensive and quantitative analysis of isoform-level transcriptomes would open an entirely new window into cellular diversity in fields ranging from developmental to cancer biology. The Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method we are presenting here has sufficient throughput and accuracy to make the comprehensive and quantitative analysis of RNA transcript isoforms in bulk and single-cell samples economically feasible. High-throughput short-read sequencing has revolutionized how transcriptomes are quantified and annotated. However, while Illumina short-read sequencers can be used to analyze entire transcriptomes down to the level of individual splicing events with great accuracy, they fall short of analyzing how these individual events are combined into complete RNA transcript isoforms. Because of this shortfall, long-distance information is required to complement short-read sequencing to analyze transcriptomes on the level of full-length RNA transcript isoforms. While long-read sequencing technology can provide this long-distance information, there are issues with both Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technologies that prevent their widespread adoption. Briefly, PacBio sequencers produce low numbers of reads with high accuracy, while ONT sequencers produce higher numbers of reads with lower accuracy. Here, we introduce and validate a long-read ONT-based sequencing method. At the same cost, our Rolling Circle Amplification to Concatemeric Consensus (R2C2) method generates more accurate reads of full-length RNA transcript isoforms than any other available long-read sequencing method. These reads can then be used to generate isoform-level transcriptomes for both genome annotation and differential expression analysis in bulk or single-cell samples. },

  abstract     = {Single cell transcriptome analysis elucidates facets of cell biology that have been previously out of reach. However, the high-throughput analysis of thousands of single cell transcriptomes has been limited by sample preparation and sequencing technology. High-throughput single cell analysis today is facilitated by protocols like the 10X Genomics platform or Drop-Seq which generate cDNA pools in which the origin of a transcript is encoded at its 5{\textquoteright} or 3{\textquoteright} end. These cDNA pools are most often analyzed by short read Illumina sequencing which can identify the cellular origin of a transcript and what gene it was transcribed from. However, these methods fail to retrieve isoform information. In principle, cDNA pools prepared using these approaches can be analyzed with Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencers to retrieve isoform information but current implementations rely heavily on Illumina short-reads for analysis in addition to long reads. Here, we used R2C2 to sequence and demultiplex 12 million full-length cDNA molecules generated by the 10X Chromium platform from \~{}3000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We used these reads to {\textendash} independent from Illumina data {\textendash} cluster cells into B cells, T cells, and Monocytes and generate isoform-level transcriptomes for these cell types. We also generated isoform-level transcriptomes for all single cells and used this information to identify a wide range of isoform diversity between genes. Finally, we also designed a computational workflow to extract paired adaptive immune receptors {\textendash} T cell receptor and B cell receptor (TCR and BCR) {\textendash} sequences unique to each T and B cell. This work represents a new, simple, and powerful approach that {\textendash} using a single sequencing method {\textendash} can extract an unprecedented amount of information from thousands of single cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
